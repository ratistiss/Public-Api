# Public- API call
<p>This Project called 12 random users to make an employee website. It features a working modal that you can loop through to see more info on employees. I also added an Aquamarine background to the body, a Khaki background to the cards, and a modal background of Wheat to help with readability. Also includes Lego pictures of the users which I found a reference on how to do.</p>
