# Public-Ac API call
This Project called 12 random users to make an employee website. It features a working modal that you can loop through to see more info on employees. I also added an Aquamarine background to the body, and a Khaki background to the cards to help with readability. Also includes Lego pictures of the users which I found a reference on how to do, through a Team Treehouse Moderators post.
